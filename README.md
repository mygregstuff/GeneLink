GeneLink, a program for robust fitting and large-scale comparison of growth curves, attempts to address the issues surrounding cell growth variability and multivariate comparisons of big data sets. We created a novel way for clustering bioinformatics data by combining multiple cluster results, offering improved flexibility and performance over existing methods. Testing several data sets, we obtain results better than current clustering methods.
